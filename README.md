meteor-scrollposition
======

Meteor package `cycore:scrollposition` is a simple, single-function package
which provides a client-side function call to return the X and Y offset coordinates
of the scroll position (coordinates of the top-left corner of the browser's view window).

The exported function is `getScrollPosition()`, which returns a two-element array.  The first
element is the `X` offset and the second element is the `Y` offset.
